Developing a full smart contract in a single response is quite involved, but I can provide you with a comprehensive outline of the smart contract you're looking to create. Once you have this outline, you can collaborate with a developer experienced in smart contract development to create the actual code.

## Smart Contract Outline for Education Token on Futureskillers.com:

### 1. Prerequisites:
- Ensure compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain and ERC-20 token standard.
- Ensure the smart contract adheres to security best practices, like checking for overflow and underflow in token arithmetic.

### 2. Contract Variables:
- `owner`: Address of the contract's owner (likely the platform's primary address).
- `totalSupply`: Total number of tokens in circulation.
- `balances`: Mapping of user addresses to their token balance.
- `allowed`: Mapping of which addresses can spend tokens on behalf of others.

### 3. Events:
- `Transfer`: Logs a token transfer.
- `Approval`: Logs approval for an address to spend tokens on behalf of another.

### 4. Constructor:
- Sets the initial `totalSupply`.
- Allocates the initial supply to the `owner` address.

### 5. Token Minting:
- Function to mint new tokens.
- Ensure that only the contract's `owner` can mint tokens.
- Increase the `totalSupply` by the minted amount.
- Emit a `Transfer` event from the zero address to the recipient.

### 6. Token Transfer:
- Users can transfer tokens to other addresses.
- Check for sufficient balances before transferring.
- Update the balance mapping after a successful transfer.
- Emit a `Transfer` event.

### 7. Token Approval and Allowance:
- Users can approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf.
- Update the `allowed` mapping to indicate the approved amount.
- Emit an `Approval` event.

### 8. Withdrawal:
- Facilitate the seamless withdrawal of tokens to a Web3 wallet.
- Update the balance mapping after a successful withdrawal.
- Emit a `Transfer` event.

### 9. Secure Transaction Processing:
- Implement a `safeTransfer` function to prevent underflow and overflow attacks.
- Include checks to ensure that only valid, non-zero addresses can transact.

### 10. Compliance:
- Implement a function to freeze or unfreeze accounts if regulatory requirements demand it (optional, but important for compliance in certain jurisdictions).
- Include a function to update compliance-related data, if necessary.

### 11. Ownership:
- Implement functions to transfer contract ownership to ensure the contract remains under control of the platform.
- Ensure that only the current `owner` can transfer ownership.

### 12. Modifiers:
- `onlyOwner`: Ensure certain functions can only be called by the contract's owner.
- `whenNotFrozen`: Ensure certain functions can only be called when an account is not frozen.

### 13. Integration:
- Ensure integration with the Laravel backend of Futureskillers.com for seamless token minting, transfer, and withdrawal.
- Develop or integrate a Web3 wallet API to allow users to interact with the smart contract from the platform.

### Final Notes:
Once you have this outline, I highly recommend working with an experienced Ethereum smart contract developer. Also, before deploying, it's crucial to have your contract audited by professionals to ensure there are no vulnerabilities or issues.
