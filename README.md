ThreatDashboard is a comprehensive project designed to import, analyze, and generate reports on various types of data. The backend of the project is built using Django CMS, while the frontend is developed using React, HTML5, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Data Import: Allows users to import their data for analysis.
- Data Analysis: Analyzes the imported data and provides detailed insights.
- Report Generation: Generates comprehensive reports based on the analyzed data.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Django CMS
- Frontend: React, HTML5, JavaScript

## Installation

### Backend

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beingnajib/ThreatDashboard.git
```

2. Navigate to the backend directory.

```bash
cd ThreatDashboard/backend
```

3. Install the required Python dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Django server.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory.

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

2. Install the required JavaScript dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React app.

```bash
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

### Backend

The backend is structured into several key files:

- `models.py`: Contains the models for the imported data, analyzed data, and generated reports.
- `views.py`: Defines the views for data import, data analysis, and report generation.
- `urls.py`: Defines the URL patterns for the views.
- `serializers.py`: Defines the serializers for the models.

### Frontend

The frontend is structured into several key components:

- `ImportData.js`: Handles the data import functionality.
- `AnalyzeData.js`: Handles the data analysis functionality.
- `GenerateReport.js`: Handles the report generation functionality.
- `App.js`: The main component that renders the above components based on user interaction.

## Detailed Description

### Backend (Django CMS)

1. `class ThreatData(models.Model)`: This class will represent the threat data. It will have fields like `threat_type`, `threat_level`, `date_detected`, etc.
2. `class Report(models.Model)`: This class will represent the generated reports. It will have fields like `report_name`, `date_created`, `report_file`, etc.
3. `def import_data(request)`: This function will handle the data import. It will parse the imported file and save the data in the `ThreatData` model.
4. `def analyze_data(request)`: This function will analyze the data and identify patterns. It will use machine learning algorithms for data analysis.
5. `def generate_report(request)`: This function will generate a report based on the analyzed data. It will create a new `Report` instance and save the report file in it.

### Frontend (React, HTML5, JS)

1. `class DataImport extends React.Component`: This component will provide the user interface for data import. It will have a file input and a submit button.
2. `class DataAnalysis extends React.Component`: This component will show the analyzed data. It will have charts and tables to visualize the data.
3. `class ReportGeneration extends React.Component`: This component will provide the user interface for report generation. It will have a form to specify the report parameters and a button to generate the report.
